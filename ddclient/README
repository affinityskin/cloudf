Currently, this includes:


======> ddclient

A port of ddclient (http://sourceforge.net/projects/ddclient/) this includes support for using the CloudFlare dynamic DNS updating system.
** We are working to integrate the CloudFlare patch into the projects main branch, but this has not happened yet. **

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS:

- Perl 5.004 or later
  (you need the IO::Socket::SSL perl library for ssl-support)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION:

  cp ddclient /usr/sbin/
  mkdir /etc/ddclient
  mkdir /var/cache/ddclient
  cp sample-etc_ddclient.conf /etc/ddclient/ddclient.conf
  vi /etc/ddclient/ddclient.conf
  -- and change hostnames, logins, and passwords appropriately 

For CloudFlare, this should be:

##
## CloudFlare (cloudflare.com)
##
ssl=yes	
protocol=cloudflare,                           \
server=www.cloudflare.com,                     \
login=myemail@foo.com                          \
password=my-cloudflare-auth-token              \
my-awsome-site.com,

To run in debug mode: ddclient -daemon=0 -debug -verbose -noquiet

See the docs at http://sourceforge.net/projects/ddclient for full configuration and installation instructions.
